## Customization

### Contact Form

The contact form is set up to log form submissions to the console. In a production environment, you should configure the nodemailer settings in `server.js` to send emails:

2. Update the `.env` file with your email credentials
3. Update the `from` and `to` email addresses as needed

### Facebook Integration

To set up the Facebook integration:

1. Replace `YOUR_APP_ID` in the Facebook SDK script in `index.html` with your actual Facebook App ID
2. Update the Facebook page URL in the `data-href` attribute of the `.fb-page` element

### Stripe Payment Integration

The website includes Stripe payment integration for booking tarot readings. To set it up:

1. Create a [Stripe account](https://stripe.com) if you don't have one
2. Get your API keys from the Stripe Dashboard
3. Update the `.env` file with your Stripe API keys
4. To test the payment system, use Stripe's [test card numbers](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards):
   - Test Card Number: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Expiration Date: Any future date
   - CVC: Any 3 digits
   - ZIP: Any 5 digits

For production, update the `.env` file with your live Stripe API keys and set `NODE_ENV=production`.

## Webhook Setup

For full payment functionality, set up a Stripe webhook:

1. Go to the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)
2. Create a new webhook endpoint pointing to your server's `/webhook` route
3. Add the `checkout.session.completed` event
4. Get the webhook signing secret and add it to your `.env` file
